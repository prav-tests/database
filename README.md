# Your Task

Design a database based on the system introduced in [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/14/6497). You only have to to hand in the ER diagram of the database, along with a document explaining the role of each *relation* and the importance of its *attributes*. In addition, if you believe that NoSQL databases might be a better choice for certain records, elaborate on that.

Note that in the paper, Section 5.1 has already suggested a database schema for the system. However, I believe that there are certain key improvements that can be made, and certain redundancies that we can get rid of.
